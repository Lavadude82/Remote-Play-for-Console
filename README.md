# Made for Anything - How it Happened
I wanted to play My PS3 anywhere in 2023, i may be weird, but I still like it.
I wanted to use it on a phone, but wait. No, you can't there is no app. That's when I got this Brilliant Idea!
There is a Place for this, like Old/Retro Consoles with a video output, you can plug an AV to HDMI or 
DVI to HDMI and ther ya go, on the cloud hosting it shall go. You can do it with  non video console, but you may have to modify which we won't take responsabilities for, but maybe your original Xbox can go with this too, using a PS4 Controller!
